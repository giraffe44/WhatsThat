# WhatsThat
version control of the whatsthat assignment, updating a long with the changes made.

learnt git later so I have uploaded backup files altogether or within a close distance
so I have decided to split the commit file by file to show what each commit did to the project.
how to run app: npm run web or npm run android
the whatsthat app behaves similar to whatsapp and similar messenger apps. 

had an issue with expo camera on web, so installed node_modules using yarn and it was fixed.
